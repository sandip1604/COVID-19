### COVID-19 prediction using Decision Tree Regressor

Since the COVID-19 was declared as pandemic, Majority of nations have started bracing themselves for once in a generation health crises. Irrespective of whether the nation is developed or developing, everyone has employed their last resorts to take the breakouts under control.

During the age of data, It would rather be useful to learn from situations around the world to prepare for the worst.

We, group of students in the Data Science class at Columbia University have developed a framework of Machine Learning models that can be scaled to the current scenario whenever this model is used.

Details of our model are as follow:

Data:
    1. Data is used from various dashboards that monitors COVID-19 statistics like John Hopkins, Worldometer, NY Times.
    2. All the Data is saved in a .CSV file latest to the date of the project.
    3. Data is cleaned and formalized into a proper data-set by removing inconstancy in Names, missing data and human errors while logging.
    
   **File for cleaned data:**
    
Testing and validation sets:
    1. Data is manipulated to incorporate onset of Local transmission, setting up 10 confirmed cases as the benchmark after which community spread is triggered. This is just based on human intuition and can be considered as a hyper parameter.
    2. Data is split into test set and train set, making sure data is evenly distributed to the range of days past the onset of community spread. So that no country has biased test and train sets.
    
 One Hot Coding:
    Important consideration we took into account was on how we incorporated the label of Country for the model. Since countries are categorical data and its distribution has no relation with mathematics, We wisely chose one hot coding. To explore deeper about one-hot coding explore the following link: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/categorical-data.
    
 Model:
    There are various ML strategies that could be equally good and can produce acceptable results. We chose Decision Tree Regressor. Reason behind this is due to its growing capacity with the number of features. Here we had 13 features ranging from GDP per capita, Healthcare expenditure of the nation to Population density and % Urban Population. In such cases Decision tree Regressor can be highly capable.

 Avoiding Overfit
    To avoid overfit, We pruned the leaves until the difference in accuracy did not surpassed our threshold.
    
 Model Parameters
    Depth of the tree : 49
    Min. samples per leaf: 7
    Min. sample split: 3
    
 Results:
    We used the metrics of R2 score and explained variance to measure the performance of the Model
    R2 score achieved is 0.91
    explained Variance score is 0.89
